# PytorchDeployment
Deploy our PyTorch model with Flask and Heroku. Create a simple Flask app with a REST API that returns the result as json data,  and then deploy it to Heroku. As an example PytTorch app we do digit classification, and at the end we can draw our own digits  and then predict it with our live running app.
